	The use of object proposals is an effective recent approach for increasing
	the computational efficiency of object detection. We propose a novel
	method for generating object bounding box proposals using edges.
	Edges provide a sparse yet informative representation of an image.
	Our main observation is that the number of contours that are wholly
	contained in a bounding box is indicative of the likelihood of the
	box containing an object. We propose a simple box objectness score
	that measures the number of edges that exist in the box minus those
	that are members of contours that overlap the box's boundary. Using
	efficient data structures, millions of candidate boxes can be evaluated
	in a fraction of a second, returning a ranked set of a few thousand
	top-scoring proposals. Using standard metrics, we show results that
	are significantly more accurate than the current state-of-the-art
	while being faster to compute. In particular, given just 1000 proposals
	we achieve over 96% object recall at overlap threshold of 0.5 and
	over 75% recall at the more challenging overlap of 0.7. Our approach
	runs in 0.25 seconds and we additionally demonstrate a near real-time
	variant with only minor loss in accuracy.},
